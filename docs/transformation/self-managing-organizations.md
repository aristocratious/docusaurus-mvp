# Self-Managing Organizations: The Future of Work Structure

Self-managing organizations (sometimes called "Teal Organizations")<sup>1</sup> represent a practical response to AI's transformation of work by operating on three breakthrough principles: **Distributed Authority** (decision-making flows to those with relevant competence rather than positional power), **Wholeness at Work** (environments where people bring their full selves including emotions, intuition, and values), and **Evolutionary Purpose** (deeper mission that transcends profit and guides strategy through collective sensing). As AI handles traditional management functions like information flow, coordination, and performance tracking, these structures enable humans to focus on ethical judgment, creative synthesis, relationship building, and meaning-making—the uniquely human capacities that become primary sources of value.

The **Complementary Strengths Framework** positions AI and humans as collaborative partners rather than hierarchical tools: AI excels at data processing, pattern recognition, and scenario modeling while humans excel at ethical judgment, creative synthesis, and navigating ambiguous contexts. This creates **Distributed Intelligence in Practice** where authority flows to whoever—human or AI—has the most relevant competence for specific decisions, consultation processes naturally incorporate both AI insights and human perspectives, and purpose-driven criteria guide when to rely on AI recommendations versus human intuition. Self-managing organizations are uniquely positioned for values-aligned technology implementation because decisions about AI use are made by those most affected, distributed authority prevents technological power concentration, and transparency cultures naturally support explainable AI systems that build trust for genuine human-AI collaboration.
