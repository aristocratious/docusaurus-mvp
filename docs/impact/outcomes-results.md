## How We Measure Success: The Dual Scorecard

To capture the full value of our integrated approach, we move beyond traditional ROI. We use a **dual scorecard** that tracks both operational efficiency and values-aligned mission advancement. This ensures that improvements in one area do not come at the expense of the other.

- **Operational KPIs**: Metrics focused on efficiency, speed, cost savings, and resource utilization. These measure how well the organization is *doing things right*.
- **Mission KPIs**: Metrics focused on stakeholder trust, empowerment, impact depth, and values alignment. These measure how well the organization is *doing the right things*.

This balanced perspective provides a holistic view of a successful transformation.
